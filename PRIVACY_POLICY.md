# Privacy Policy

User Interface Options Plus (UIO+) allows you to customize websites to match your own personal needs and preferences.
Settings for the adaptations can be set via the UIO+ adjuster panel. Due to the nature of applying user preferences,
UIO+ requires permission to interact with the web content in the browser's windows, tabs, and iframes.

## Information UIO+ collects

UIO+ makes use of user preferences, collected via direct user input to its adjuster panel. To apply certain adaptations,
(e.g. syllabifiaction, text-to-speech) the content of active websites may be parsed.

## How UIO+ uses the information

UIO+ is directed by the user preferences to augment/adapt websites to the user's needs and preferences. Typically this
involves modifying the page styling, but may also require parsing website content (e.g syllabification, text-to-speech).

## What information does UIO+ share

UIO+ does not explicitly share any information. All of the user preferences collected are stored locally within the
extension, for persistence across sessions. Content parsed from websites is only stored temporarily, for the time needed
to apply/remove the adaptation. However, because the extension may need to communicate with injected scripts, modify
HTML markup, and/or apply styles within a website, it is possible that the website being adapted may be able to infer
the user preferences being applied.
