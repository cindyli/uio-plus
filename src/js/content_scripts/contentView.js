    /*
     * `gpii.chrome.contentView` is a type of view component which extends the typical viewComponent facilities for
     * searching for selectors. The extended features allow for searching for "content" amongst a variety of selectors,
     * and returning the first one found. This is useful when trying to determine the primary content of a page, and is
     * typically used by enactors acting upon an entire document without explicit knowledge of the primary content area.
     *
     * The content is located upon component creation and stored in the `content` member. The `content` option can be
     * set with an array of selector names to determine which selectors should be used to search for the content. The
     * order determines which selectors to look through first. The search will terminate after the first selector
     * that returns elements. If none of the selectors is able to locate any elements, the value stored in the
     * `defaultContent` is returned or if that is not provided, an empty jQuery object is returned.
     *
     * Additionally, methods are provided to find selectors scoped within the content (`locateInContent`) or scoped to
     * the container, but outside of the content (`locateOutOfContent`). These methods behave similarly to calls to
     * `locate`; which is also still available for use. However, they cannot be used in IoC expressions like `locate`
     * can.
